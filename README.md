Setup Development Environment with me!

I believe a good environment helps us develop quick, easy and be cool.

### FZF

### Vim

Simple setup.

1. Download Vim plugin manager: [vim-plug](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug#installation)
2. Copy .vimrc to your `~/.vimrc`
3. Reload `.vimrc` and `:PlugInstall` to install plugins
